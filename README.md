# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

``` 
The latest (fourth) iteration of my working Portfolio Page, build with React.js, as well as a few handy npm packages: react-scroll allows visitors to smoothly navigate to any given section of the page with ease and precision, while 'popupbox' offers a way to preview/link to an assortment of projects. Some packages were simply design-oriented, like particles.js and react-typed, whereas others, like email.js, provide an easy way to interact with the page host by emailing potential project ideas. Ultimately, though building a React portfolio for the first time certainly had its challenges, the process proved to be a great learning experience. Below are a few links, as well as screenshots of the final product.
